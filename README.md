# M5
This is my collection of experiments using ESP32 devices from M5Stack, e.g. the [AtomMatrix](https://docs.m5stack.com/#/en/core/atom_matrix).

I use PlatformIO with the Arduino framework. All examples are part of a single PlatformIO workspace. 
It should also be possible to open the individual examples/folders directly in the Arduino IDE.

Some examples use forked libraries with modifications/enhancements, that you can find in my other repositories.

Notable examples include:

-  [AtomMatrixVernie](AtomMatrixVernie) : controlling a Lego Boost robot (e.g. Vernie) wireless with the AtomMatrix and its accelerometer

-  [Wiimote](Wiimote) : using Nintendo Wii Remote/Nunchuk as wireless input device for ESP32 (e.g. to control a robot)
